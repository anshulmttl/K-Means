# K-Means
K-Means algorithm in c++
This is a K-Means clustering algorithm written in C++. It is not generic as i did not have time to write all that but can be extended. 
Also it is for fixed input array length 10x4. For different array length or dynamic array length the code has to be modified to change indices (10 & 4).
